<h5> 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle (2021.4.2)</h5>
Found that after perform the given instruction once, it can only change its direction to one of 90,180,270,360 degrees.<br>
Meaning that after some iteration, it comes back to facing the north side.<br>
When it faces to the north again, if it is at the origin, it can be on a circle.<br>
Otherwise, it will go farther from the origin.
